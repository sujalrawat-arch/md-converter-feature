2. Slotted vials-At the start of media fill First seal the 100 empty vials then fill and seal 100 Mannitol
test result. After receiving pass report of leak test start the filling and sealing and collect filled and
2. During filling Temperature, Humidity and differential pressure, pressure shall be monitored and
4. Vial of composite samples-Collect media filled vials from initial, middle and end in single tray.
5. After receiving pass report from QC Department & clearance from QA start the media fill activity.
4. Microbiologist shall Collect the empty Vials, Seals and Rubber stoppers carefully and send to
